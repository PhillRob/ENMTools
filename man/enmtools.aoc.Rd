\title{Takes an overlap matrix and a tree and runs permutation tests to
determine the statistical significance of the relationship between
overlap and time}
\usage{
enmtools.aoc(clade, nreps, overlap.source, env = NULL, model = NULL,
  overlap.matrix = NULL, metric = "D")
}
\arguments{
\item{clade}{An enmtools.clade object containing species data and a phylogeny}

\item{nreps}{A number of reps to do}

\item{overlap.source}{The source of the overlaps to calculate.  Choices are "bc", "dm", "gam", "glm", "mx", "range", and "point"}

\item{model}{The model to be used for GLM and GAM comparisons}

\item{overlap.matrix}{A matrix of overlaps to use, for option overlap.source = "matrix"}

\item{metric}{The overlap metric to use. For ENM sources, this can be any combination of "D", "I", "cor", "env.D", "env.I", and "env.cor".
for range and point overlap this argument is ignored.}
